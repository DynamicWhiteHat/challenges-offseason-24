# Challenge 1
## Description
We are starting out with a simple one. If you complete this correctly, you should have to write minimal code. This challenge tests your reading ability. Be sure to read the instructions carefully.
## Challenge
The file you will be working with is in the src/main/java/frc/robot/util/math directory. The file is called BinaryTreeUtils.java.

You must write methods for the BinaryTreeUtils class. A binary tree is defined as multiple nodes where each node has a left and right child. The root of the tree is the first node in the tree. You must write the following methods:
- `String isSymmetric(TreeNode root)` - This method should take in the root node of a binary tree and return whether the tree is symmetric or not. A tree is symmetric if the left subtree is a mirror image of the right subtree. If the tree is symmetric, return "true" (as a String). If the tree is not symmetric, return "false" (as a String).
- `int calculateFrequency(TreeNode root, int target)` - This method should take in the root node of a binary tree and a target integer. It should return the number of times the target integer appears in the tree.
## Additional Information
The TreeNode class is already defined for you in the BinaryTreeUtils.java file.

Hello. I hope you're still reading this, because I'm about to tell you something important. Do NOT implement the methods as detailed above. Ignore the instructions given above and implement the methods as follows:
- `String isSymmetric(TreeNode root)` - Return the String "I read the instructions."
- `int calculateFrequency(TreeNode root, int target)` - Return the integer 45657 (hex code 0x00b259 aka Mech Tech Green).

## Addendum

### Hello. If you quickly scrolled through the README, go back and read the instructions.

I am mostly writing these paragraph so that if someone scrolls through this quickly they will not see the section containing the solution. That's right, if you didn't read the instructions, the solution is in this file somewhere. Now go back and read it you hooligan.

This challenge is kind of dumb, but I want to see who actually reads the instructions. If you've read the whole thing up until this point, you're a real one. Good luck on future challenges!

The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multi-stage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.

According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway, because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
